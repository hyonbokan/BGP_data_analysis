    " * What is a BGP collector?\n",
    " \n",
    "    A BGP collector is a system that collects BGP updates from multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes) and stores them in a database for analysis. BGP collectors are typically operated by research organizations, network operators, or other entities that need to analyze BGP routing data for various purposes, such as monitoring network performance, detecting routing anomalies, or studying Internet topology. BGP collectors can be public or private, and they typically use peering relationships with ASes to obtain BGP updates.\n",
    "* How does a BGP collector obtain BGP updates?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A BGP collector obtains BGP updates through peering relationships with ASes. Peering is a process by which two ASes agree to exchange BGP updates with each other. BGP collectors typically establish peering relationships with multiple ASes to obtain a diverse set of BGP updates. The peering relationships can be bilateral or multilateral, and they can be established through various means, such as direct connections, Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), or Route Servers. Once a BGP collector has established peering relationships with ASes, it can receive BGP updates from them and store them in a database for analysis.\n",
    "* What information is included in a BGP update?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A BGP update typically includes the following information: - Prefix: The IP address range being advertised or withdrawn. - AS path: The sequence of ASes that the update has traversed, starting from the origin AS and ending at the peering point with the collector. - Next hop: The IP address of the next hop router that should be used to reach the advertised prefix. - Origin: The origin of the update, which can be either an AS or an External BGP (EBGP) peer. - Local preference: A value used by the AS to indicate its preference for a particular route. - MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator): A value used by the AS to indicate the preferred exit point for a particular route. - Community: A tag used by the AS to group routes and apply policies to them. BGP updates can also include other optional attributes, such as Aggregator, Atomic Aggregate, and Originator ID.\n",
    "* How is BGP data stored and analyzed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    BGP data is typically stored in a database for analysis. The database can be a relational database, a NoSQL database\n"

    " \n",
    " * Pros: \n",
    "    - Visibility (user-side): The chosen intervals for updates (15 minutes) provide users with more up-to-date information about changes in the routing table, which can be useful for real-time analysis and monitoring. \n",
    "    - Granularity: The chosen intervals for updates (15 minutes) provide a more granular view of changes in the routing table, which can help in identifying specific events or anomalies. \n",
    " \n",
    " * Cons: \n",
    "    - Disk space (provider-side): The chosen intervals for updates (15 minutes) can result in a large amount of data being generated and stored, which can increase the storage requirements for the provider. \n",
    "    - Processing time: The chosen intervals for updates (15 minutes) can result in more frequent processing and analysis of the data, which can increase the processing time and resource requirements for the provider. \n",
    "    - Accuracy: The chosen intervals for updates (15 minutes) may not capture all changes in the routing table, as some changes may occur between the dump intervals. This can result in some changes being missed or delayed in the data. Overall, the chosen intervals for updates (15 minutes) provide a more granular view of changes in the routing table, but can also result in increased storage and processing requirements for the provider. The choice of intervals should be based on the specific needs and requirements of the users and providers, and may vary depending on the context and use case.\n"
