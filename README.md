# Assignment 7: Explore ROV deployment using BGP2GO and BGPStream

This repository contains my personal implementation of Assignment 7 from the course CSE291E Internet Data Science for Cybersecurity, taught by Prof. KC Claffy at UC San Diego.

## Description
The goal of this assignment is to explore and analyze raw BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing data to address the research question of which collector peers forward ROA-invalid updates to the collector. The assignment covers various aspects of BGP data analysis, including parsing MRT files, using CAIDA's BGP2GO system, and working with BGPStream. Additionally, a Python script is included in the repository to demonstrate the extraction of BGP updates using BGPStream.

**Please note** that I am not a student at UC San Diego, and this repository represents my personal attempt at completing the assignment. As a self-learner, I found it valuable to work on fundamental CS courses independently. While I have made efforts to ensure accuracy, there may be mistakes. Nonetheless, I hope this repository can be helpful to others with a similar background who are learning CS fundamental courses on their own.
